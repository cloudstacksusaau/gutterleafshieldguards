	<p>
	Gutters are a vital part of the drainage system on a house, directing water away from the building. They also serve as an outer wall to protect against wind-blown rain and snow, while preventing moisture from entering the home. Gutters can be made out of metal or plastic, but they should always have a protective coating such as paint or vinyl sealant applied to them after installation in order to prevent rusting or other types of corrosion over time.
